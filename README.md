# Stevens Esports Application Sheet Splitter

This script takes an incoming Excel Spreadsheet full of Google Form responses for applications, and splits them up into their respective games. It asks for a single character, designating the row where applicants selected their games, and then outputs an .xlsx spreadsheet file with all of the responses divided between sheets representing games. Column-width is accounted for to promote readability.
